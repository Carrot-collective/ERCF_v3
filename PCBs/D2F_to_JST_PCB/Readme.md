## D2F to JST PCB

Design by TheRogueZeta.

## Instructions

First, remove the middle leg of the D2F microswitch. Cut or file it down as close to flush with the D2F microswitch body as possible, as any remaining leg will interfere with the PCB.

Next, solder the JST connector to the PCB. PH (2.0mm), XH (2.5mm) or 2.54mm connectors all fit. Once cool, trim the protruding legs of the JST connector. You want them as close to flush as you can get without damaging the solder joint.

Next, add a printed shim or Kapton tape to the microswitch to prevent shorting the middle leg of the D2F microswitch on the JST connector.

Finally, solder the microswitch to the PCB as flush as possible.
