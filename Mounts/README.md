# ERCF Mounts repository

Welcome to ERCF mounts repository. This is a place to share your mounts for ERCF and find mounts and resources from other ERCF community members.

All mods that apply to older (legacy) ERCF versions can be found in the [`legacy_mounts`](./legacy_mounts) folder.

Looking to submit a mount? Check the [mount submission rules](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v3/blob/main/Mounts/Mount-Submission-Rules.md) and instructions on [how to submit to Mounts](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v3/blob/main/Mounts/How-to-Submit-Mounts.md)
