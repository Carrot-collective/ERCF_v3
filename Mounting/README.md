Because mounting is specific to your printer, mounting is left for the community to do. 

# Community Submission Information

The following are guidelines for submitting documentation to the ERCF Mounting repo. This is to provide a consistent format for the resulting documentation and information.

## All submissions

All submissions must include the following content in the header of any templated files to be rendered. Any submissions missing this header may be rejected.

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```
---
layout: default
title: <title>
nav_exclude: true
---
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## How to Submit your Design

Each submitter should create a directory for their user. The directory name should preferably be the same as their Discord username or Github username. Each guide should be named accordingly but include the markdown ".md" extension (e.g. 'how\_to\_build\_ercf.md'). If there are images to be included, it is recommended to create an 'images' subdirectory for all of the images and link to those in the guide.

Each pull request should also update the associated index.md with a link to the macro and the creator's username.
