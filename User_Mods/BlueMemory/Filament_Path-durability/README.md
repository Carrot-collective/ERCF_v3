# Filament_Path_Pregate_Switch-durability mod

Thanks to kinematicdigit for the detailed response to my previous issue #1.

Now I understand that the resistance mechanism achieves its purpose through friction against the structural parts, essentially replacing the older "traps." 

My interpretation is that a force is applied via the MR85 bearing to press the filament against the printed housing to create the necessary friction.

Implement a wear-resistant 3x10mm dowel pin to enhance the overall lifespan
