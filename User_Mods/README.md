# ERCF user mod repository

Welcome to ERCF user mod repository. This is a place to share your mods for the ERCF v3 and find useful mods and resources from other ERCF community members.

Mods where the authors have abandoned development can be found in the [`orphaned mods`](./orphaned_mods/) folder. If you want to start maintaining one of them, feel free to reach out via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v3/issues/new/choose).

Looking to submit a mod? Check the [mod submission rules](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v3/User_Mods/Mod-Submission-Rules.md) and instructions on [how to submit to ERCF User_Mods](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v3/User_Mods/How-to-Submit-to-User_Mods)
